This homework had four parts. The first to make and remove a file with the commit 59ebb5d which is shown below. /n 
Next we had to play around with data from NYC Open Data repository. I made a few graphs to visualize information. /n
Then we used the MTA api to scrape real-time information about the buses with a python script. /n
I worked on my own :/ but was able to do it! /n
The first script shows the latitude and longitude of the active buses. /n
The second script uploads the location and information about the next stop into a csv file format.
