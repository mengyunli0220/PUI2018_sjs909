This homework had four parts. <br/>
First to create and remove a file with the commit 59ebb5d which is shown below. <br/>
Second to play around with data from NYC Open Data repository. I made a few graphs to visualize information saved in the Jupiter notebook called HWAssignment2 <br/>
Third, I used the MTA api to scrape real-time information about the NYC buses in a python script. <br/>
I worked on my own :/ but was able to figure it out! <br/>
The first script shows the latitude and longitude of the active buses. <br/>
The second script uploads the location and information about the next stop into a csv file format. <br/>
