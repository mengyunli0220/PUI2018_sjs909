**Assignment 1: census geospatial analysis.** <br>
I worked on this assignment alone, I had some assistance from Rohun Iyer when I got stuck merging. <br>
He helped to remind me that I need to convert the PUMA to int before merging, furthermore to merger with how = "outer" when I want to keep the rows that didn't have LinkNYC kiosks<br>
<br>
***Key Takeaways*** <br>
This assignment helped me: 
  * to familiarize with the US Census data 
  * exercise with spatial analysis in geopandas
I looked at where linkNYC stations are located and analyzed the population density and broadband internet coverage for each PUMA. 

**Data Used** 
  * American Fact Finder data via API and direct download
  * NYC shapefiles
  * LinkNYC
