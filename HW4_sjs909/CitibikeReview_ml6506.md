#### a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
* The Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
* Signficance level is set.

#### b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)
* I think the data is good for the project.

#### c. chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nuts
* I think one tailed z-test which compare two groups is proper statistical test for this case.

## Some comments
* The graphs are not very clear and beautiful to show the duration difference. Since the Null hypothesis throughout the months of January and August, we could show their difference of every months in graphs.
