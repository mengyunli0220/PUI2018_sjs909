CLARITY: The plot is relatively easy to read, however the scale is different for each plot and the values are not sorted...making it a bit difficult to identify the most popular breed. Also for Manhattan the legend is covering where it says Chihuahua.  

ESTHETIC: Interesting to see the breakdown of dog breed for each borough. It was helpful to have the plots listed one under the other. The color choices are nice. However when I tested it for deuteranopia, it makes the Bronx and Queens bar charts look exactly the same color. I'd recommend changing the color of one to keep in mind this common color blindness. 

HONESTY: With regard to the difference in scale, perhaps if you had broken down the number of dog breeds per capita to keep this constant would be helpful. These plots could be percieved as having the same amount of dogs, but the y scale is pretty different.
