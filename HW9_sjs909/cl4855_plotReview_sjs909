![Dog Breed](plots/Dogbreed.png)

Interesting to see the breakdown of dog breed for each borough. It was easy to see that the Yorkshire Terrier is one of the most popular in each one. However it would have been helpful to sort the columns so this would be more apparent. Also for Manhattan the legend is covering where it says Chihuahua. 

Furthermore, the scale on each graph is different. Perhaps if you had broken down the number of dog breeds per capita to keep this constant would be helpful. These plots could be percieved as having the same amount of dogs, but the y scale is pretty different.

Lastly, I tested it for deuteranopia, and that makes the Bronx and Queens bar charts look exactly the same color. I'd recommend changing the color of one to keep in mind this common color blindness.
