**Assignment 1:** <br>
I forked Marvin's Repository and viewed his CitiBike data assignement. The goal was to identify the appropriate test for analyzing his hypothesis. <br>

**Assignment 2:** <br>
I worked together with Rohun Iyer and Andrew Hill to split the different section of test research. <br>
I found an article that used a 1-way ANOVA test to look at the accumulation of anthropogenic litter and its ecosystem effects in urban freshwater ecosystems. <br>
