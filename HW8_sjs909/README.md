Notice the color pallete has been tested for color blindness in mind. For this assingmnet, my goal was to make a parsimonious plot. Additionally, there is no redundant information shown.

Please find the code I used to create the plot under the file Assignment1.

A more extensive report that I am currently working on for the New York State Department of Health is included in this repo, under NYHealth.

<br>

In this report, I am looking at the percentage of claims for this preventative HIV/AIDS drug called PreP. Specifically, comparing the proportion of Females compared to Males that file claims with MediCaid. The reason for choosing these two counties are from the map derived below as reference. <br> Data about claims filing was provided by the New York State Department of Health.

**Assignment 2**<br>

We reviewed our Citi Bike project from HW 4, where Andrew Hill and I explored our hypothesis of ride duration as a factor of user type. We recieved feedback from a peer review and incorporated this into our methodology. <br>

We decided a t-test was the most appropriate analysis to test our hypothesis because we were comparing the trip duration time between two samples, Customers and Subscribers.

The python notebook is included in this repository.

Below is a link to our report: <br>
